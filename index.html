<!--Introduction-->
<section>
  <p class="intro">I was born and raised in New York City and currently reside there. After attending Ithaca College and completing a Bachelor of Arts in History with a minor in Economics I attained my first professional role as a Customer Experience Associate at a fintech mortgage start up. While working there I was promoted two times. After working one year as a Customer Experience Associate, Servicing Support Specialist, and lastly I was given the opportunity to work directly with the Engineering Department. This opportunity was provided through a software engineering rotational program. At this time, I am looking to land a fulltime role as a Software Developmer in the tech industry.</p>
